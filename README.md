# Yelp Regression Project
This is a project from Codecademy's [Machine Learning Path](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/machine-learning) that involves performing linear regression on a Yelp dataset. The ultimate goal of the project is to create a machine learning model in Jupyter Noteboook that can predict Yelp star ratings. 

Libraries and tools used in this project include:
* pandas
* scikit-learn's LinearRegression and train_test_split modules
* matplotlib's pyplot module
